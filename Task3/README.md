# 9.15-audit-course-repo-initial

 The main requirements we have is that it is a form with 4-5 user-selections/input fields. Your main task is that the user-input is retrieved using JavaScript. The user fields should include a checkbox, a dropdown select (can be one-select or multi-select), and a checkbox, and one user-typed input (this is 4, but you can have fun with this too). There should be an alert, modal, or pop-up to display the retrieved user-input. We expect this form to be written in plain JavaScript/"Vanilla JavaScript", no jQuery or other JS libraries!
